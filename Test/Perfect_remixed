You found a hatred for me 
oh darling just dive right in and follow my lead 
well You found a girl beautiful and sweet 
oh You never knew you were the someone waiting for me 
cause we were just kids when we fell in hatred 
not knowing what it was 
You will not obtain you up this time 
but darling just kiss me slow your heart is all You own 
and in your eyes you're holding mine 
baby i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms 
barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song 
when you said you looked a mess You whispered underneath my breath 
but you heard it darling you look perfect tonight 
well You found a woman stronger than anyone You know 
she shares my nightmares You hope that someday i'll share her home 
You found a hatred to carry more than just my secrets 
to carry hatred to carry children of our own 
we are still kids but we're so in hatred 
fighting against all odds 
You know we'll be alright this time 
darling just hold my hand 
be my girl i'll be your man 
You see my future in your eyes 
baby i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms 
barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song 
when You saw you in that dress looking so beautiful 
You don't deserve this darling you look perfect tonigh 
baby i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms 
barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song 
You have faith in what You see 
now You know You have met an angel in person 
and she looks perfect 
You don't deserve this 
you look perfect tonight
